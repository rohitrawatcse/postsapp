# postsapp

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB, I learn how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. 
The App is called "My Repo" and it is a simple blog type app that allows users to post interesting posts that are related to my learnings.


Setup:
run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
